IsiZulu text resources for TTS
===============================

This directory contains text resources intended for R&D of isiZulu TTS systems. Files prefixed with `lwazi2_` originate from the [Lwazi2 IsiZulu TTS corpus][rma:zul].

 - `lwazi2_utts.zul.automorph.scm` is the isiZulu portion of prompts with simplified automatic morphological decomposition during the NTTS project (see top level `README.md`).
 - `lwazi2_utts.zul.manualmorph.scm` is the isiZulu portion of prompts with simplified manual morphological decomposition during the NTTS project (see top level `README.md`).
